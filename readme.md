# Learning Next.js

Welcome to the **Learning Next.js** repository! This is a space where I document my journey of learning and exploring Next.js.

## About Next.js

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a powerful React framework for building web applications. It enables developers to build static, dynamic, or server-rendered web pages with ease. Next.js comes with features like automatic code splitting, server-side rendering, and an intuitive file-based routing system.

## My Learning Journey

I'm currently on a learning journey to master Next.js and understand its concepts, features, and best practices. This repository serves as my personal playground, where I experiment with Next.js projects, implement various features, and document my insights.

Feel free to explore the code, check out the projects, and follow along with my learning progress. If you're also diving into Next.js, let's learn together and share our experiences!
